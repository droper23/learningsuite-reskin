/**
 * Confirmed live (Sep 2026, real-usage pass): the Grades page's default "Assignments"
 * sub-view (`/student/gradebook`) renders the exact same `main .bg-base.text-highlight` row
 * grid and `.lineHeight > div.cursor-pointer` category headers as the real course-level
 * Assignments page — same title/due/score/completion cell shape, confirmed against a real
 * 171-row gradebook (7 categories). This adapter reuses assignmentsAdapter.ts's extraction
 * and card-building directly rather than re-deriving the same parsing twice for the same
 * DOM shape.
 *
 * `pageDetector.ts`'s `looksLikeGradesPage()` is what actually tells this page apart from
 * real Assignments (both used to collide on the DOM-shape check alone until an earlier pass
 * fixed the false-merge by excluding Grades from `looksLikeAssignmentsPage()`; this is the
 * mirror-image positive match using the same confirmed `.bg-top-nav-highlight === "Grades"`
 * signal) — never a guessed URL segment.
 *
 * A native "Course Progress" stat panel was searched for on this pass (real account, MATH
 * 113's gradebook) and not found above the row list — ROADMAP.md has flagged this same gap
 * across multiple prior passes as "still no non-generic hook." Left untouched here too,
 * fail-soft, exactly like every other not-confidently-extractable element on this project;
 * re-check if a future pass finds a real selector for it.
