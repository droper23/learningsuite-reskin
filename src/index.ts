 * Confirmed live: LearningSuite has its own independent dark-mode toggle

 * `prefers-color-scheme` — a user can have either in either state, and
 * LearningSuite ALWAYS gives this signal one way or another (the class is
 * either present or absent — there is no "LearningSuite is silent" case).
 * So "system" here means "match what LearningSuite itself is actually
 * showing" — full stop. Reproduced live: OR-ing in `prefers-color-scheme`
 * broke this exact case — LearningSuite in native light mode
 * (`html.className === "h-full"`, no `dark` class) with the OS/browser set
 * to a dark color scheme painted this reskin's dark header/nav over
 * LearningSuite's own light content, producing white-on-white and
 * beige-on-black. `prefers-color-scheme` is never consulted here: the site
 * signal is always available, so there is nothing for it to be a fallback
 * for. Always sets an explicit dark/light attribute — see tokens.css, which
 * has no bare `prefers-color-scheme` fallback path of its own.
 *
 * `html.classList.contains("h-full")` (confirmed live present on every real
 * LearningSuite-rendered page regardless of dark/light) is the actual "site gave a signal"
 * check, not just "dark is absent" — confirmed live a genuine native error page renders
 * `<html class="">`, neither `h-full` nor `dark`. Without this, that case fell through to
 * a hardcoded `light`, flipping a Dark-mode account's whole reskin to light outside the
 * SPA's own state (Sep 2026 fix). The last real (non-fallback) reading is persisted via
 * getSetting/setSetting (src/lib/storage.ts) and reused instead, so a stray error page
 * inherits whatever the user was just actually looking at.
